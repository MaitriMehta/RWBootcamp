Create an RGB Color Picker
RGB is a Color Model where a combination of Red, Green and Blue values are combined to create millions of different colors. Each value is represented by an integer from 0 to 255.

Your task is to create an app that allows users to pick a Red, Blue and Green value within this integer range and use the resulting values to color the background of the app appropriately.

The UI should consist of the following:
A label near the top of the view (for displaying a color name)
3 Sliders, one representing each color range
A label above each slider (Used to indicate what that slider is for)
3 labels, each positioned next to a slider, capable of displaying a string
A button called “Set Color”
A button called “Reset”

The sliders should default to the leftmost position, and the labels should show 0 by default. The title labels above the sliders should read “Red”, “Green” and “Blue” in that order.

When moving a slider, the label to its right should update with an integer from 0 - 255.

When the “Set Color” button is hit, an alert should appear asking the user to enter a color name (the name doesn’t control the color - it’s just a label like ‘my color’!). Once a name is entered and the user presses “Enter” on the keyboard, the background of the app should change to a color corresponding to the RGB values entered by the sliders and their color name should appear in the top label. The alpha value should be hard-coded to 1.0, as we won’t be addressing transparency here.

When “Reset” is hit, the sliders, labels and background color should return to the default values.

The app should have a splash screen and app icon (see Resources below).
The app should work in landscape and portrait orientation.
The app should have an info button that presents the wikipedia page for RGB. That page should have a Close button to dismiss it.
