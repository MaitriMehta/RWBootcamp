#  Why struct

Tried class and felt its over code. Constuction and more references. 
Here data is simple so its good to use struct over the class. It's a game so multithreaded enviroinment may be achived by safely.
- Used struct (value type) as don't want to use any inheritance and most of the values won't change after its created.
